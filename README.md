# BARK Protocol: SUI-Based Crowdfunding Platform

Welcome to the BARK Protocol GitHub repository! This repository contains the codebase and documentation for our decentralized crowdfunding platform built on the SUI blockchain. The BARK Protocol aims to provide a secure, scalable, and user-friendly solution for fundraising, leveraging the high-performance capabilities of the SUI blockchain.

## Overview

The BARK Protocol is designed to enhance the efficiency, security, and transparency of fundraising campaigns. Our platform supports multi-currency contributions, integrates decentralized storage solutions, and uses advanced security measures to ensure a reliable and trustworthy experience for users and campaign creators.

### Key Features

- **SUI Blockchain Integration:** Utilizes the high-performance SUI blockchain for fast and secure transactions.
- **Decentralized Storage:** Employs Arweave/IPFS for durable and censorship-resistant data storage.
- **Smart Contracts:** Automates fundraising processes and enforces campaign rules using SUI’s native programming language.
- **Cross-Chain Functionality:** Incorporates Chainlink and PYTH oracles for real-world data integration and enhanced functionality.
- **User-Friendly Frontend:** Built with React.js, providing an intuitive interface for campaign management and donation processing.
- **Wallet Integration:** Supports SUI-compatible wallets for secure authentication and transactions.

## Architecture
